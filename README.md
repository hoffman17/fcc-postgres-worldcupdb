This project was the second of five for my relational databases certification. Here I created a database using PostgreSQL and used a bash script to extrapulate information from a .csv file to populate my databse. Additionally, I have a separate queries.sh file that is demonstrating my knowledge of SQL commands to query the databse to pull different information.
